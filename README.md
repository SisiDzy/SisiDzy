My name is Zeyu(Sisi) Dong. I am passionate about data analysis and digital media, which can be shown by my continuous internships in these two areas. Currently, I am looking for a position of Data Analysis or Data Scientist. I believe my skills in Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, Excel, and so on, make me a strong fit for being a data expert.
